So The build Phase is the Time when you can place the towers just use the buttons given on the bottom to place them also u can reposition already place by clicking right mouse button to pick and then left mouse to place. 
To make a connection first click on the Crystal(Yellow Diamond) and then click on the desired tower
everything will be output in the console to better understand 
Iitially i have set the 1 turret and 1 mortar limit to be placed
the build time is set to 10seconds 
every parameter can be tweaked through thread manager , build manager , game manager
